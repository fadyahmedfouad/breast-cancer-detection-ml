# Breast Cancer Detection using Deep Learning & Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to detect breast cancer from ultrasound images using deep feature extraction and classical machine learning models.  
It combines:
- Swin-B (deep feature extractor)
- SVM, Random Forest, and MLP classifiers
- Ensemble learning for improved performance

The goal is to assist medical diagnosis by providing automated classification of ultrasound images.
